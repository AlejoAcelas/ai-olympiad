# Word Vectors Gone Wrong: Fixing Gender Stereotypes in Language Models

## Problem Description


Language models process words as arrays of  numbers, called word vectors (or word embeddings). These vectors are created based on the usage of the words in context, so they capture the distributional properties of words. Word vectors can be conceptualized as unique coordinates in a multi-dimensional space, with the distance between them capturing the semantic and syntactic relations between words.

In a seminal [article](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1158/) Ekaterina Vylomova and colleagues show that word vectors trained on English data exhibit a curious property: the spatial difference between the vectors of 'king' and 'queen' is the same as the difference between the vectors of 'man' and 'woman'. This difference essentially captures **gender**. Similarly, the difference between 'king' and 'man' is the same as that between 'queen' and 'woman', capturing the notion of royalty.

The way gender is reflected in word vectors has received special attention in NLP, because while sometimes word vectors capture true gender roles (e.g. a king is by definition male), other times they capture undesirable societal biases, e.g. they place 'engineer' and 'man' in the same relationship as 'housekeeper' and 'woman'. This does not seem fair, given that professions such as engineer or housekeeper should be non-gender specific.

We don't want to have models that promote stereotypes about which jobs are suitable for men or women, so we should find a way to fix this problem. The tasks presented in this notebook will guide you to one possible solution.

## Technical Specifications

All team solutions should be submitted as a modified and compiled copy of this base notebook. You also need to provide a file of the word vectors you created.

The notebook contains specific tasks you need to accomplish and provides code when necessary. Some cells, marked with the `###DO NOT CHANGE THIS CELL###` comment, have to remain as they are. Other cells can be changed, especially the ones saying `###YOUR CODE GOES HERE###` should be changed to complete the tasks.


Your goal is to get familiar with word vectors and the problem of bias which is a common issue in Artificial Intelligence applications.

## Resources

You can read more on gender bias in word vectors in the paper [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf) by Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, and Adam Kalai. Proceedings of NIPS 2016.

There are some articles/tutorials online that explain the main concepts of the paper (neutralization and equalization of word vectors) such as [Debiasing Word Embeddings with Geometry](https://medium.com/@mihird97/debiasing-word-embeddings-with-geometry-d2c471ab4ae6).

##Task 1: Creating word Vectors for words

One popular method for obtaining word vectors is to use a pre-trained model such as Word2Vec or GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation).

## Task 2 - Implement Cosine Similarity

We can measure how similar are two words using cosine similarity. We would expect non-gender specific words to be equally distant from gender specific words.

ðŸŽ¯ The goal is to get familiar with calculating cosince similarity using python and try to find similar words that are an example of bias and unbiased vectors. We can measure how similar two words are using cosine similarity!

Deliverables: Provide code for implementing cosine distance in Python. Run the example words, and try measuring the distance of different words. Can you find a biased and an unbiased example?

To calculate cosine similarity, we need to take the cosine of the angle between these two vectors. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the dot product of A and B
   - Multiply each element in A with the corresponding element in B
   - Sum all those products
   - Call this dot_product

2. Calculate the magnitudes (or lengths) of A and B
   - Square each element in A, sum them, and take the square root. Let's call this mag_A.
   - Do the same for B. Let's call this mag_B.

3. Compute cosine similarity:
   cosine_similarity = dot_product / (mag_A * mag_B)

The closer this value is to 1, the smaller the angle and the more similar document A is to document B.

Thanks to Python, you do not need to do these time-consuming calculations manually! Especially for step 1 and step 2, there is a library called 'numpy' with functions that can help you implement cosine distance in Python!

After getting familiar with all the tools we need, now it's time to actually solve the problem of bias in word vectors.

ðŸŽ¯ The goal is to implement a neutralize and equalize Python functions to remove the bias from the word vectors.

Deliverables: (1) Complete the python code for the neutralize and equalize python functions following [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf) by Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, and Adam Kalai. Proceedings of NIPS 2016. The code should run without any errors. (2) Provide examples before and after removing bias.

To remove the gender bias from non-gender specific word vectors, we need represent the semantic concept of gender as a vector. We can approximate that vector by subtracting female and male word vectors. This means we can compute a vector 'vgender = v1 - v2', where 'v1' represents the word vector corresponding to the word woman, and 'v2' corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word man. The resulting vector roughly encodes the concept of "gender".

We'll see below how to reduce the bias of these vectors, using an algorithm due to Boliukbasi et al., 2016. Note that some word pairs such as "actor"/"actress" or "grandmother"/"grandfather" should remain gender specific, while other words such as "receptionist" or "technology" should be neutralized, i.e. not be gender-related. You will have to treat these two type of words differently when debiasing.

An approach to remove the bias would be to neutralize and equalize the bias for non-gender specific words, following Bolukbasi et al, 2016.
